To sort the list, I used the sorted() function, set the key = lambda x: x["Fee"], so that it sorted by the fee field, and then when I wanted the highest values I set reverse=True. For averages, I would add up all of the values and then divide by the length of the list. For the next highest total, I took the first 9 values and the 11th value and added their fees together. When I wanted to get the value of the transactions, I used the .split() function and put in the argument of " ".
